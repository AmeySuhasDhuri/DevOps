<h1 id="head">GIT</h1>





<p>Git is currently the most popular implementation of a distributed version control system.</p>


<p>Git originates from the Linux kernel development and was founded in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. Nowadays it is used by many popular open source projects, e.g., the Android or the Eclipse developer teams, as well as many commercial organizations.</p>


<p>The core of Git was originally written in the programming language _C, but Git has also been re-implemented in other languages, e.g., Java, Ruby and Python.</p>

<h2 id="head">GIT Repositories</h2>


<p>A Git repository contains the history of a collection of files starting from a certain directory. The process of copying an existing Git repository via the Git tooling is called _cloning. After cloning a repository the user has the complete repository with its history on his local machine. Of course, Git also supports the creation of new repositories.


If you want to delete a Git repository, you can simply delete the folder which contains the repository.</p>


<p>If you clone a Git repository, by default, Git assumes that you want to work in this repository as a user. Git also supports the creation of repositories targeting the usage on a server.


Bare repositories are supposed to be used on a server for sharing changes coming from different developers. Such repositories do not allow the user to modify locally files and to create new versions for the repository based on these modifications.


Non-bare repositories target the user. They allow you to create new changes through modification of files and to create new versions in the repository. This is the default type which is created if you do not specify any parameter during the clone operation.



A local non-bare Git repository is typically called local repository.</p>
