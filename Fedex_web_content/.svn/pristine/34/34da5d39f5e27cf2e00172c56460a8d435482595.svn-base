<h1 id="head">SoapUI</h1>
<p>SoapUI is an open-source web service testing application for service-oriented architectures (SOA) and representational state transfers (REST). Its functionality covers web service inspection, invoking, development, simulation and mocking, functional testing, load and compliance testing. A commercial version, SoapUI Pro, which mainly focuses on features designed to enhance productivity, was also developed by Eviware software. In 2011, SmartBear Software acquired Eviware.</p>
<p>SoapUI was initially released to Source Forge in September 2005. It is free software, licensed under the terms of the European Union Public License.[4] Since the initial release, SoapUI has been downloaded more than 2,000,000 times.[5] It is built entirely on the Java platform, and uses Swing for the user interface. This means that SoapUI is cross-platform. Today, SoapUI also supports IDEA, Eclipse, and Net Beans. </p>

<p>SoapUI can test SOAP and REST web services, JMS, AMF, as well as make any HTTP(S) and JDBC calls.</p>

<h1 id="head">SoapUI Pro</h1>

<p>SoapUI Pro is the commercial enterprise version. SoapUI Pro adds a number of productivity enhancements to the SoapUI core, which are designed to ease many recurring tasks when working with SoapUI.</p>
